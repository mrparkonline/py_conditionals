# Conditional: If Statements
---

__Conditionals:__ Features of programming language that allows different computations to occur based on decision making.
- Conditionals are dependent on Boolean expressions that are evaluated to __True__ or __False__.
- Different texts will define conditionals to be statements, expressions, or constructs.
- The use of conditionals is the way to control the _flow_ of a program.

### ```if``` statement

- ```if``` is a built-in keyword in Python that allows us to write conditional statements.
- if statements will only execute their own _block_ of code if its boolean condition evaluates to __True__.
- if the boolean condition doesn't evaluate to True, the program will skip its _block_ of code
- Block of code or __Code Block__ in python are started by a (:) colon and indentation. (Examine the example below)

```python

# if statement formatting template

if (boolean_expression_here): # notice the colon to start the if's code block
    # single indentation
    
    code written here
# end of the if statement

code written here ... outside of the if statement
```


```python
# Code Example 1
num1 = 10
num2 = 42
target = 34

if target >= num1 and target <= num2:
    print(target, 'is in between', num1, 'and', num2)
```

    34 is in between 10 and 42



```python
# Code Example 2
word = 'Hello'

if len(word) >= 6:
    print(word, 'is too long.')
    
print(word)

# Notice that the message 'Hello is too long' is not outputted.
# This is because len(word) is less than 6 hence len(word) >= 6 is False
```

    Hello
